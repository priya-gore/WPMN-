CGI (Common Gateway Interface) vs Servlets:

1. **Process Handling**:
   - CGI creates a new process for each request, consuming more memory and CPU.
   - Servlets are multithreaded and run within the same JVM, making them efficient.

2. **Performance**:
   - CGI scripts are slower due to process creation overhead.
   - Servlets are faster as they handle requests within the same thread.

3. **Scalability**:
   - CGI struggles with high traffic due to excessive resource usage.
   - Servlets scale better due to efficient memory management.

4. **Programming Language**:
   - CGI scripts are usually written in Python, Perl, or Shell.
   - Servlets are written in Java and run within a Java EE environment.
